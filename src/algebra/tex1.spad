++ Author: Robert S. Sutor
++ Date Created: 1987 through 1990
++ Change History:
++ Basic Operations: coerce
++ Related Constructors: TexFormat

++ Description:
++   \spadtype{TexFormat1} provides a utility coercion for changing
++   to TeX format anything that has a coercion to the standard output
++   format.

TexFormat1(S : SetCategory) : public == private where
  public  ==  with
    coerce : S -> TexFormat()
      ++ coerce(s) provides a direct coercion from a domain S to
      ++ TeX format. This allows the user to skip the step of first
      ++ manually coercing the object to standard output format before
      ++ it is coerced to TeX format.

  private == add
    import from TexFormat()

    coerce(s : S) : TexFormat ==
      coerce(s :: OutputForm)$TexFormat
