* Official |git repository| (read-only access). Fork it on github if
  you like.
  ::

    git clone https://github.com/fricas/fricas.git

* Release tarballs (up to version  1.3.6):
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/fricas/files/fricas/.

  The release tarballs are identical to the respective version in the
  |git repository|, but additionally contain pregenerated (machine
  independent) files, i.e., compilation from release tarballs takes
  less time.
