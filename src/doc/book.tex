\section*{General note}
This is the original Axiom book from 1992 with title %
``\emph{AXIOM---The Scientific Computation System}'' by Jenks and
Sutor in its adaptation for the \Language{} fork of the Axiom source
code.

It counts as the official version for the \Language{} project.

The original sources (including the text and scripts) for this book
where released in 2002 under the modified BSD license that is found in
the file \texttt{license/LICENSE.AXIOM} in the source code repository
of \Language{}.

\section*{Warning}
Since this book is a moving target, each part of its generation is
automated. In particular, the output of \Language{} commands
(including their typesetting in \LaTeX{}) is automated. However, that
sometimes means that you see boxes with output that does not fit the
width of the page. We use the breqn \LaTeX{} package to break
equations appropriately. Unfortunately, that does not always work
nicely.

If you find other inaccuracies, please report them to the mailing list
\href{mailto:fricas-devel@googlegroups.com}{fricas-devel@googlegroups.com}.

\section*{Authors}

% Unfortunately ug07 uses \item[\spadfun{foo}] which doesn't work
% since \spadfun has a verbatim-like argument. Fortunately, that only
% happens inside the description environment. So we simply redefine it
% for this chapter. Better rewrite the text in ug07.
